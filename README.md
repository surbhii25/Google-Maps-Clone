# Google Maps Clone

Google Maps is a web mapping platform and consumer application offered by Google.
In this project, I tried to make a Clone of Google Maps using Mapbox.

Mapbox is an incredibly powerful tool for creating any map based applications.

Concepts Learned while making this project:
1. How to setup Mapbox
2. Geolocation API
3. Mapbox plugins
